This project was was inspired by the popular [spinning cat memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/maxwell-the-cat-spinning-cat). It allows a custom spinning cat to be generated from an input photo. As part of the pipeline, we implement the paper [Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/research/quilting/quilting.pdf), which we use to generate the fur texture for the 3D model.

This project was completed as a partner final project for CSCI1290, Computational Photography, at Brown University.
